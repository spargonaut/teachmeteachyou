TODO:
- need (functional?) test to cover the loading of multiple workshops on the main page.


questions:
should the buildSrc directory be in the application direcotry or the root directory?


immediate to do:
- break functional test flow into three tests for three users
-- user that creates the workshop
-- user that is interested in the workshop
-- user that can teach the workshop
-- update readme with minimums

Infrastructure to do:
- 'npm install' should be run using a gradle task
- build pipeline (Austin)
- okta (pat mcfadden)
- docker? (Austin)
- gitlab

functionality to do:
- should show the number of people interested in the same workshop on the workshop list page
- should show the date created on the workshop details page
- should show the number of people interested (on workshop details page)
- should be able to add further details to the workshop
- user creating workshop can indicate what days are best for them
- user showing interest in a workshop can indicate what days are best for them
- user able to teach can indicate what days are best for them
- user able to teach can indicate the minimum number of students required before teaching
- system will alert all users interested in the workshop that a teach has been found
